# Particle Simulation 🌟
I've made my own **Particle Simulation**! 🎉 This is a simple and interactive particle simulation project built using **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++. 🚀

## 📜 Overview
The Particle Simulator lets you visualize particles moving and interacting with each other on the screen. It demonstrates basic physics principles, such as particle movement and collision detection, using a graphical interface.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run it, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dheovani/ParticleSimulation.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have SFML and CMake installed. You can install SFML using vcpkg or any other package manager.

### 3. Build the Project
Navigate to the project directory and create a build folder:

```bash
cd ParticleSimulation
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

### 4. Run the Simulator

```bash
./ParticleSimulator
```
